# Design Process

I wanted to make a survey formed quiz about the difference between human and AI. I created 10 different questions that represents human or AI's charateristics, and gave them scores. The higher the score is, you are closer to human. However, when you retake the quiz when you are closer to human, the quiz will try to force the user to choose the selection with lower score until they get lower score.(trying to make the useres closer to AI)

# Inspiration and References

I have been interested in compare and contrasting human and AI. I have come to the conclusion that they are very much alike, however, there are some crucial differences. I wanted to depict how AI is made by written prompt and is forced to do anything, while human has a free will.

# Challenges

Honestly everything..I especially struggled a lot with storing the data and recalling it. I had to research a lot to figure out how to approach to what I wanna do. It was harder since I was trying to make the same quiz with different results depending on the previous result.

# Next Steps

I would like to create more alert messages and make them randomly pop up.
Also, since I am not very sure about 4 pages(requirement), I should figure out what to do.
